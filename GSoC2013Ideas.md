_If GSoC 2013 happens, and CCF is accepted, this will one day be our ideas page_

This is the Climate Code Foundation's list of projects and ideas for Google Summer of Code 2013 (GSoC).  GSoC is a programme funded by Google where students work on open source projects and earn a stipend for doing so.  For more about GSoC, see their website (_link will be put here_).

If you are interested in the Foundation, and in GSoC 2013, please join the <a href='http://mailman.climatecode.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-2013'>mailing list</a>  (_which doesn't exist yet_) to discuss these ideas.

**To take part as a student**, go to the GSoC2013Template page and follow the instructions there.  It is not hugely complex, but every year some students get it wrong.  If you get it wrong, your proposal will not be accepted and you will not take part.

**To take part as a mentor**, contact us by email.  Note that mentors will not earn a stipend (but will receive our gratitude, and a GSoC T-shirt).
