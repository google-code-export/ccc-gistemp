### Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2012? What do you hope to gain by participating? ###
We hope to:
  * improve the public understanding of climate science;
  * promote better practices among climate scientists;
  * foster the Open Source spirit among aspiring students;
  * grow the community around the Foundation;
  * increase the public visibility of the Foundation.

(This is the same answer as last year, when our participation did achieve all these goals).

### Did your organization participate in past Google Summer of Codes? If so, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation. ###

We participated for the first time in 2011.  We mentored 3 students, all of whom passed.  Their projects strengthened and broadened our development work significantly.

All three students presented at the Python symposium at the American Meteorological Society annual meeting in New Orleans in January 2012, spreading the good news of GSoC far and wide.

Those projects also created or bolstered working relationships between the Foundation and several academic climate science groups (NCDC, USC, LDEO).  The NCDC in particular was so pleased with Dan Rothenberg's project that a program director there wrote to us (and to Carol) to thank us (and Google) for the project.

Furthermore, their projects have been excellent material for many presentations given by Foundation members to scientists, promoting the use of open source software, and arguing for the greater use of open source licenses.  As a result we have been approached by a number of scientists and groups interested in working with the Foundation, in publishing their own code as open source, and in future GSoC participation.

I would identify 4 particular challenges of our 2011 participation:

> - mentoring students remotely, without any face-to-face contact: by requiring frequent email and IRC contact we were able to cope with this OK.  Still, it was good to finally meet the students face-to-face (after GSoC finished).

> - mentoring on new bodies of code: two projects were new libraries, with which the mentors weren't familiar, so the mentors had to do quite a lot of work to 'keep up'.

> - mentoring earth-sciences students: although all our students were experienced programmers, two of them were not computer scientists, so weren't as familiar with some aspects of the field.  Involving students from outside the usual open-source community is important to us.

> - Working together, remotely, with earth-scientist mentors.  The mentors brought indispensable expertise, but they didn't have any experience with web frameworks or software ecosystems.  We resolved this with co-mentoring by the org admins.

### If your organization has not previously participated in Google Summer of Code, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)? ###

N/A

### Does your organization have an application template you would like to see students use? If so, please provide it now. ###

### What criteria did you use to select your mentors for this year's program? Please be as specific as possible. ###

The criteria we used were:

  * availability;
  * either relevant scientific expertise (several project ideas are associated with specific climate scientists who will act as mentors) or a proven track record in managing software projects;
  * familiarity with open-source tools and techniques;
  * commitment to the goals of the Foundation.

### What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? ###

As software contractors and consultants we have long experience of software subcontract management.  The key risk in that area is non-delivery, and the key activity to reduce that risk is regular interaction, tracking and oversight.

We think abrupt disappearance of a student is unlikely.  Far more likely is gradual disaffection or failure to progress, leading to eventual "disappearance".

If a student is losing interest or motivation, or not progressing with the project, we need to discover this and take action as soon as possible.  With that in mind, we request detailed email progress updates from students once per week, and hold weekly IRC project meetings, in addition to more-frequent informal interaction (notionally "daily progress reports", although we are explicitly relaxed about this: a changelog or a five-line IM chat is plenty).  We make it clear to students up-front (in the template!) that this reporting is _not_ optional and we _will_ fail students who often fail to report.  Through this interaction we can identify problems early and take action accordingly.  This was very successful in 2011.

We will not fail a student for absence without first making some efforts to contact them and resolve problems.  We require email, phone, and IM contact details, and information about each student's institution, through which we will attempt to contact an absent student.  Ultimately we care about project outcomes, and a short absence (e.g. for a family or health crisis) can easily be made up later in the summer.  Similarly, many students have travel plans or workshops over the summer, and a one or two week break in the project for good cause, with notice, is not automatically a problem.  But we _will_ fail any student who disappears without cause, and we _will_ fail any project which doesn't have satisfactory outcomes.

If a student is losing interest in their project, or finds that they lack a necessary skill or resource, we will help him or her to find alternative ways of moving forward.  Our organization goals are very broad, and there are many different project outcomes which could promote those goals.  We are long-standing advocates of evolutionary development: specifications should always evolve over the course of a project.  A project which exactly meets an initial specification is less use than one which has evolved over time to meet an improved specification.  Not one of our 2011 projects delivered exactly on its proposal: they were all more successful, but in different ways, than initially envisaged.

### What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? ###

Most mentors will be Foundation staff or close associates, in which case there is negligible likelihood that they will disappear.  Academic mentors will always be paired with technical mentors.  In either case, we have identified some backup mentors, and we expect most communications to be shared so that other mentors can be kept up to speed should they need to step in.

### What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program? ###

  * Before: we are already in contact with a few potential students, after announcing our possible involvement on our blog and a couple of climate-science and Python mailing lists.  We expect more to appear once the Foundation is accepted as a mentoring organisation.  Students are free to join our gsoc-2012 mailing list, and after confirmation as a mentoring organisation, we will encourage potential students to do so. We make it clear on the ideas page that showing up on the list to discuss ideas is essential to a successful proposal.

After project selection, we will contact selected students directly and engage with them individually, inviting them to meet us in person or by IM as they find their way around our existing code bases or the problem domain of their project.  We will use our gsoc-2012 mailing list - including students, mentors, and interested others - for all GSoC-related traffic, to help build a sense of community.

  * During: As detailed above, we will require daily updates (by email, IM, IRC, Skype, RSS, etc) and hold weekly all-hands meetings by IRC.  We will also be holding other coaching or mentoring sessions by IRC - for instance last year we did some semi-formal Code Inspection exercises which were very helpful.  For students in Western Europe, we will try to meet in person once or twice during the project.  Depending on the project, we may have mentors elsewhere in the world who can meet their students.  For some projects (for instance, anything to do with our ccc-gistemp code base) we will be taking part in software development alongside the student.

  * After: For successful projects with ongoing post-project development work, we will create a per-project mailing list running, and encourage the student to remain on it.  Many of our project ideas connect naturally with parts of the climate science community, and we expect students on such projects will form networks through that.
