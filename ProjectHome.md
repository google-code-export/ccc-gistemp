This is the source code repository for Clear Climate Code, a project of the [Climate Code Foundation](http://climatecode.org/).

We have a <a href='http://clearclimatecode.org/'>blog with other information pages</a>.

Our current project is a reimplementation of [GISTEMP](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) in Python for clarity.  GISTEMP is a reconstruction of the global historical temperature record from land and sea surface temperature records.  It produces a familiar graph of historical temperatures:
