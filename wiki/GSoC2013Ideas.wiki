#summary Google Summer of Code 2013 Ideas Page [DRAFT]

= Introduction =

_If GSoC 2013 happens, and CCF is accepted, this will one day be our ideas page_

This is the Climate Code Foundation's list of projects and ideas for Google Summer of Code 2013 (GSoC).  GSoC is a programme funded by Google where students work on open source projects and earn a stipend for doing so.  For more about GSoC, see their website (_link will be put here_).

If you are interested in the Foundation, and in GSoC 2013, please join the <a href="http://mailman.climatecode.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-2013">mailing list</a> to discuss these ideas. _which doesn't exist yet_

*To actually take part as a student, go to the GSoC2013Template page and follow the instructions there*.  It is not hugely complex, but every year some students get it wrong.  If you get it wrong, your proposal will not be accepted and you will not take part.
